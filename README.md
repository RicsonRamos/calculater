# Tkinter Calculator
This is a calculator project developed in Python using the Tkinter library. As a beginner learning to code, this project was an opportunity to explore the basics of GUI (Graphical User Interface) programming and practice programming logic concepts.

Key features:

Simple and intuitive graphical interface.
Support for basic math operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Additional functionalities, including square root calculation and factorial computation.
This project is part of my learning journey, and I'm open to feedback and suggestions to improve and expand its functionalities.
